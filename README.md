# ioBroker.notificationforandroidtv - Benachrichtigungsintegration f체r Android TV/Fire TV

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/iobroker.notificationforandroidtv.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/iobroker.notificationforandroidtv/)

# ENGLISH

Notification integration for IoBroker includes support for Notifications for [Android TV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.cyberdream.androidtv.notifications.google) and Notifications for [Fire TV](https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Fees-Notifications-for-Fire/dp/B00OESCXEK). With this integration, you can send notifications to your Android TV device. It enables an overlay displaying the message content for a customizable duration before disappearing. Additionally, it supports sending images, such as those from security cameras, and custom icons. Icons function similarly to images, appearing smaller and to the left of the notification, while images display larger and above the notification.

These notifications operate within the global scope of your Android TV device, appearing regardless of the active application.

During setup, note that there are two distinct apps: one for your smartphone (which isn't necessary for this platform) and another for your Android TV device to receive notifications. The app required for displaying notifications sent from IoBroker is available in the store of your Android TV device. Any in-app purchases are exclusive to the client for Android smartphones and do not restrict pushing notifications from IoBroker.
